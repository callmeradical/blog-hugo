        Working on large scale unified APIs seems to be a popular trend. Recently I was working with Microsoft&rsquo;s Graph API, which is their unified API. It is not unreasonable to think that many different teams contribute to the different resources available; mail, calendars, contacts, directories. However many resources, the idea is to have all of them referenced from the same endpoint. Ideally each team could use whatever language, whatever technology best worked for them.

        This is going to be my very feeble attempt to explain the Raft consensus algorithm. The very least I will accomplish is sharing the material I have read about Raft and how I have come to understand it. Raft is used in popular pieces of software such as RethinkDB, etcd, and a number of Hashicorp products.(1) What is Raft? Raft was developed in the hopes of creating an easy to understand consensus algorithm.

      <div class="content">
        Service discovery is not new, but I still see plenty of shops storing their configuration in the form of configuration files or hardcoded objects. Connecting to an instance of MySQL or Redis and hard coding connection strings beforehand doesn&rsquo;t allow one to take full advantage of dynamic resources and also doesn&rsquo;t allow for treating them as backing resources. We are going to take a quick walk through setting up a consul cluster using docker-machine and have registrator dynamically create entries in consul&rsquo;s service catalog.

        I saw this study by the folks over at Google and their 2nd Generation Cloud SQL. The results they posted didn&rsquo;t exactly mirror what I saw when running the benchmarks for myself. You can get the raw data here @ Github. Everything was stood up using Terraform, the benchmark tests were conducted using Sysbench, and all data was plotted using R. Since we didn&rsquo;t have access to Google&rsquo;s original data, we provided some overlays in the post as an easy visual comparison.

        Firstly a huge thank you goes out to @mipsytipsy for this awesome post mortem on what appears to be or what could have been one of the worst outages of her career. Some context: our terraform config had been pretty stable for a few weeks. After I got it set up, I hardly ever needed to touch it. This was an explicit goal of mine. (I have strong feelings about delegation of authority and not using your orchestration layer for configuration, but that’s for another day.) And then one day I decided to test drive Aurora in staging, and everything exploded.

        I came across this post in a slack channel earlier today and thought it was some pretty sound advice for those starting out in the container eco system. First: Containers are immutable – The OS, library versions, configurations, folders, and application are all wrapped inside the container. You guarantee that the same image that was tested in QA will reach the production environment with the same behaviour. Second: Containers are lightweight – The memory footprint of a container is small.

        Reading is definitely a passion for me. I love reading every chance I get. So few books have stuck with me or have become even a flavor of the week that I feel like I have to recommend Greg McKeown&rsquo;s Essentialism again. I came by another post, not long after reading Greg&rsquo;s book, talking about priorities and the nonsense it creates. The Myth of Multitasking Yes, we are capable of doing two things at the same time.

        Yeah you saw that right. This new Microsoft confuses me almost on a daily basis. Part of me thinks that this is awesome, and then another part yells at me for thinking it is awesome. I think it is great that Microsoft is looking to make good with the open-source community. They are the second largest contributor to Docker outside of Docker, and now this push to put SQL Server on Linux is yet another attempt to break bread.

        I don&rsquo;t typically subscribe to books about decision-making or &ldquo;life hacking&rdquo; or even time management. I just finished my second read of Essentialism by Greg McKeown. I read through it the first time, and I was skeptical. After my second read, I can say I am a believer. I can&rsquo;t recommend this book enough. I have had trouble divorcing myself from work for a while. I would always be the guy saying; &ldquo;Let me just finish this one last thing.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I just have to send this e-mail.&rdquo; Essentialism has helped me tune out the noise and focus what really matters.
