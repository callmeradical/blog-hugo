        Hey Andre, Look at this!
Over the past 5 months I have been working on a team of about five people on a shared workstation.
Originally I had my reservations about other people working on the same machine as everyone else, but was quickly swaying to use it myself. Rather than set everyone up on their windows laptops (which I still think is a huge barrier for entry) our workstation was originally set up to help other people start coding, developing, and learning ruby.

Registration was amazingly fast, all of the staff have been incredibly polite, and immediately after getting through registration I got my first piece of swag!
So it is not all sunshine and rainbows, there is some work to be done.

        Let me start by saying this, I can&rsquo;t stand vSphere Data Protection, however I feel that since it is offered for free, and there is little to no management or maintenance for the virtual appliance, I see no reason in keeping it from my vSphere environment. That being said I still prefer to use Veeam for reliable backups of our virtual infrastructure at least on a weekly basis.
So anyway lets get started.

        So if you are ever in a pinch and need to use a piece of optical media, you can operate the CD-rom door via Command Line when you SSH into your ESXi Mac Pro.
For instance: (Enable ssh in the Security Profile of the Configuration tab on the vSphere client. Remember to turn this off after you are done.)
$ ssh root@esxi.host.machine # cd /dev/cdroom # ls # eject vmp.*.*  That will then eject your tray, leaving you to wondrously explore legacy optical media that no one wants.

 Precise error: Failed to connect to VMware Lookup Service. SSL certificate verification failed. I had been playing around in my lab and I am guessing this error was caused by the fact that I changed the hostname of my vCenter Server Appliance after configuring it.
