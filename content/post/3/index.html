Over the past 5 months I have been working on a team of about five people on a shared workstation.
Originally I had my reservations about other people working on the same machine as everyone else, but was quickly swaying to use it myself. Rather than set everyone up on their windows laptops (which I still think is a huge barrier for entry) our workstation was originally set up to help other people start coding, developing, and learning ruby.

Twitter CLI: t a command line twitter app which is pretty awesome.
National Vulnerability Database this has been around for a while and might be old hat for most of you out there, however people newer to system administration will find a wealth of information here, relating to the security of their infrastructure.

Registration was amazingly fast, all of the staff have been incredibly polite, and immediately after getting through registration I got my first piece of swag!
So it is not all sunshine and rainbows, there is some work to be done.
Today I started off with a hands-on lab getting my hands into setting up security profiles with the IAM credential system and then configurring instances of S3, EC2, and EBS.

That being said I still prefer to use Veeam for reliable backups of our virtual infrastructure at least on a weekly basis.
So anyway lets get started.

For instance: (Enable ssh in the Security Profile of the Configuration tab on the vSphere client. Remember to turn this off after you are done.)
$ ssh root@esxi.host.machine # cd /dev/cdroom # ls # eject vmp.*.* That will then eject your tray, leaving you to wondrously explore legacy optical media that no one wants.
