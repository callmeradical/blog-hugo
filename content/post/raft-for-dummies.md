Say you have 2 friends out to lunch, we will call them Bill and Sue. You have been having a grand old time but now it is time to pay the bill. The receipt comes and you pass it around to determine who owes what. Everyone puts money in, including yourself. As you add it up you notice that you are 5 dollars below the total check. So you proceed to go down the receipt saying what everyone ordered. No one claims the nachos that the table ordered.
