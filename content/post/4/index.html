More after the jump for the solution. At first I tried this method, which is outlined here, Yellow-bricks
Precise error: Failed to connect to VMware Lookup Service. SSL certificate verification failed. I had been playing around in my lab and I am guessing this error was caused by the fact that I changed the hostname of my vCenter Server Appliance after configuring it.

Here is a little backstory on the situation. I found myself almost immediately scouring the internet one morning when my boss had told me there was a problem with our server (at this point in time it was our only server) that was currently running OS X 10.7, Lion. I was not a fan of Lion server as it was a major departure from the server OS we all knew and loved.

Nitrous.IO is an awesome service that is still currently in Beta, that allows you to set up VM&rsquo;s ruby development. Currently it looks like they are primarily supporting Ruby, Python, JavaScript, and GO with frameworks such as Node.js, Rails, and Django. I was super excited about this service a while back and am happy to see that it is working so well.

For those of you not familiar with puma you can check out more information here - Puma. and if that is too much to read, it can be summarized hereâ€¦
Puma is a very lightweight and incredibly fast web server that was built for speed and parallelism. For comparisions of other webservers check out the link above.

I also didn&rsquo;t really see much value other than setting a &ldquo;base&rdquo; system.
However after working with puppet and reading some of the other posts by Gary Larizza I think that boxen can really be summed up into an intelligently designed way to run puppet in an organization that requires more freedom for its users than typical.

This should by default always return the most recent tagged release or branch name.
You can store this variable in the environment.rb file of your project by appending this line of code: APP_VERSION = git describe --always unless defined? APP_VERSION
